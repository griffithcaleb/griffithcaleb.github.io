For this project I decided to utilize the iTunes search API. I used three attributes of this data: the length (time in milliseconds), a link to the album art and the title of a specific song.

The approach I took with this data was based on the idea that a person should be able to schedule times during the day to play music, based on their specifications. I used a series of input fields (date of event, name of event, time of event and intensity level of music ) to gather the user input needed to generate the playlists. By comparing the length of songs to the time of a specific event, the user is able create a playlist exactly the length needed for their event.

Using a scale set from 1-10, the user can also set the "intensity level" for their music during an event. These levels are search terms of specific genres. Using my professional experience in the world of music, I set each level of "intensity" based of my extensive knowledge of specific genres.


### Looking forward

I envision a future version of this project with the following functionality:
1. Integration with calendar app
2. Autoplay options for a users playlist
3. Use of the Spotify API, which has much more specific data about each song. - To customize at a higher level.
4. Individual user login and storage of playlist data.
